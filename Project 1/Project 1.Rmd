## Loading the txt File

The first step is to read the txt file into R as a table, and save it

```{r cars}
chess <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mattr5541/DATA-607/main/Project%201/Chess.txt", 
                    header = T, sep = "|", skip = 1, fill = T, quote = "")

glimpse(chess)
```

## Cleaning the dataframe

**Since the resulting dataframe is less than interpretable, the next step will be to clean the dataframe by removing any extraneous lines, characters, and columns. I started by removing all hyphens, cutting out some empty columns, and then by merging columns and rows where appropriate. This was accomplished by making a grouping variable called "merge" that groups every two together; I then created a new dataframe called chess_clean where all instances of "merge" that matched would be grouped into one row, and then, of course, I dropped the merge variable. Finally, I cleaned up any trailing spaces that were present in the observations**

```{r}
chess <- data_frame(chess)

chess <- subset(chess, Pair != '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------')

chess <- chess[-1,]

chess <- chess[-11]


chess$merge <- rep(1:(nrow(chess) / 2), each = 2)
chess_clean <- chess %>% group_by(merge) %>% summarize_all(~paste(., collapse = "")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% select(-merge)

chess_clean <- chess_clean %>% mutate_all(trimws)

chess_clean$Pair <- trimws(chess_clean$Pair)

chess_clean$Player.Name <- trimws(chess_clean$Player.Name)
```

## Separating Variables 

**I then separated the now-cleaned chess dataset where appropriate by using regular expressions and dplyr's separate function. This took quite a bit of trial and error to properly parse out the correct values, primarily due to the many uneven spaces throughout the observations**

```{r}

chess_sep <- chess_clean %>% separate(Pair, c('Pair', 'Player_State'))

chess_sep <- chess_sep %>% separate(Player.Name, c('Player.Name', 'Rating'), sep = " / R: ")

chess_sep$Player.Name <- gsub("[[0-9]+", "", chess_sep$Player.Name)   

chess_sep$Player.Name <- trimws(chess_sep$Player.Name)

chess_sep$Rating <- gsub("^[P].+|>.+", "", chess_sep$Rating) 
chess_sep$Rating <- gsub("P\\d*|[- ]", "", chess_sep$Rating) 

chess_sep$Total <- gsub("N:\\d+", "", chess_sep$Total) 
```

## Converting to long format 

I then converted the dataframe to a long format in order to more easily match the opponents' ratings with each player (essentially, I wanted to convert the rounds into a grouping variable so I could match the opponents with the "Rating" column, and eventually, the "Pair" column). After that, I created a new dataframe consisting of the Pair IDs, and renamed "Pair" to "Opponent" and "Rating" to "Opponent_Rating." I then merged this into the chess dataframe, in order to match each "player with their corresponding opponents' ratings

```{r}
chess_long <- chess_sep %>% gather("Round", "Opponent", 6:12)

chess_long$Opponent <- gsub("[A-Za-z]", "", chess_long$Opponent)

chess_long$Opponent <- as.numeric(chess_long$Opponent)

Ratings_sep <- chess_long %>% select(Opponent_Rating = Rating, Opponent = Pair)


chess_long <- chess_long %>% arrange(Opponent)

Ratings_sep <- Ratings_sep %>% arrange(Opponent)

chess_merge <- merge(chess_long, Ratings_sep, by = "Opponent") %>% distinct()
##Just to fix the overall layout of the players
chess_merge <- chess_merge %>% arrange(Pair)
```

## Setting to Wide & Calculating Averages

**Finally, I set the dataframe back to a wide format, calculated the row averages for every round, in order to determine opponent averages, and performed some last-minute cleaning procedures (removing unnecessary columns/renaming columns)**

```{r}
chess_wide <- chess_merge %>% pivot_wider(id_cols = c(Pair, Player.Name, Player_State, Total, Rating), names_from = Round, values_from = Opponent_Rating)

chess_wide$Pair <- as.numeric(chess_wide$Pair)

Rounds <- chess_wide[,c(6:12)]
Rounds <- Rounds %>% mutate_at(1:7, as.numeric)

Rounds$Opponent_Average <- rowMeans(Rounds, na.rm = T)
Rounds$Opponent_Average <- round(Rounds$Opponent_Average, digits = 0)

chess_wide$Opponent_Average <- Rounds$Opponent_Average

chess_wide <- chess_wide %>% select(-c(1, 6:12))

chess_wide$Total <- as.numeric(chess_wide$Total)
chess_wide <- chess_wide %>% rename("Player_Name" = "Player.Name")

kable(chess_wide)
```

## Visualization

**Now that everything is set up, it's time to make a little visual demonstration for some of the values**

```{r}
chess_avg <- chess_wide %>% select(Player_State, Total)

Avg_by_State <- chess_avg %>%
  group_by(Player_State) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(Total), list(Total = mean))

ggplot(Avg_by_State, aes(x = Player_State, y = Total)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "Average Score by State", x = "State", y = "Score")
```
**The graph above demonstrates that Ohio had the highest average score when compared to ON (which I am assuming is Ontario?) and Michigan. However, that is not entirely meaningful, since Ohio only had one player. The more meaningful comparison would be that Ontario(?) had a higher average player score than Michigan**

##Saving as a CSV

**The final step would be to save the cleaned and modified dataframe as a CSV file**

```{r}
chess_csv <- chess_wide
  
write.csv(chess_csv, "chess.csv", row.names = F)

```
